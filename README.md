# prime-tester
A Python program for doing things with prime numbers.

Launching the program grants you with a selection menu.
Here, three options open to you :
- Check if a number is prime
- Display every prime number up to a given number
- Benchmark your system with prime numbers

Checking if a number is prime is done efficiently by three functions:
- The first one (isDivisibleByThree) checks the last digit of a given number. If that digit is a 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 or 8, then the number can't be prime because it can be at least divided by 2 or 5.
- The second one (isDivisibleByThree) ... to be continued
